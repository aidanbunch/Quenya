# Quenya

Quenya is a minimalist media sharing service that destroys your media after they're viewed (or after 24 hours, if you prefer). Think of it as Snapchat for one-off media sharing, but through URLs instead of an app.

Quenya lets you generate a unique URL, drop your media, and know it'll be gone after its job is done.

## How it works

1. Pick a URL (like quenya.vercel.app/sunset2024)
2. Drop your media (up to 50MB)
3. Choose whether it self-destructs after first view or 24 hours
4. Share the link
5. That's it! The media vanishes once viewed (or when time's up)

## The interesting bits

- No accounts needed
- Works with any media format you'd expect (JPG, PNG, GIF, WebP)
- Drag & drop or click to upload
- Built with Next.js, Supabase, and runs on Vercel
- Open source because why not

Made this because I love the idea of ephemeral content and wanted a dead-simple way to share media that clean up after themselves. Hope you find it useful!
